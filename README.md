# numpy.random-project 2019

This repository contains my research project about the numpy.random package as part of the assessment in the *Programming for Data Analysis* module for the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics with Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.


## About this Repository

The repoistory can be accessed or downloaded [here](https://github.com/jennifer-ryan/numpy.random-project) and contains:

1. A README file that outlines the layout of the project.
2. A Jupyter Notebook that contains discussions about various functions in the **numpy.random** package and code to help illustrate them.


## 2. Project Description

While the [numpy.random documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.16.0/reference/routines.random.html#) explains how to use each of the functions I discuss herein, this project is an attempt to describe the functions in simpler, more accessible language. 

The project is split into the following sections that reflect the sections in the **numpy.random** documentation:

- Simple Random Data: the most basic functions in the package that return random values or arrays of values. 
- Permutations: functions that shuffle the values of a sequence.
- Distributions: functions that allow values to be chosen from a wide range of probability distributions.
- Random Generators: functions that allow the user to set the seed of the pseudorandom number generator.

Throughut the project I use 'random' as a descriptive term for readability purposes, even though everything generated from the **numpy.random** package is pseudorandom. To illustrate how each function operates, I use plots, descriptive statistics and some classic practical examples (coin flipping, card shuffling).
