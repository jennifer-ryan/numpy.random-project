# numpy.random-project 2019

This repository contains a research project about the numpy.random package as part of the assessment in the *Programming for Data Analysis* module for the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics with Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.


## About this Repository

The repository can be accessed [here](https://github.com/jennifer-ryan/numpy.random-project). Clicking the 'clone or download' button will allow you to download the repository to your machine. Some of the output, such as the table of contents, bold text in code output, and image placement, seem to not have translated correctly to the GitHub repository but should function as intended on a local machine. 

The contents of this repository are:

1. A **README** file that outlines the layout of the project.
2. A **Jupyter Notebook** that contains discussions about various functions in the **numpy.random** package and code to help illustrate them. The notebook contains a table of contents to aid navigation.


## 2. Project Description

While the [numpy.random documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.16.0/reference/routines.random.html#) explains how to use each of the functions I discuss herein, this project is an attempt to describe the functions in simple, more accessible language. 

The project is split into the following sections that reflect the sections in the **numpy.random** documentation:

- Simple Random Data: the most basic functions in the package that return random values or arrays of values. 
- Permutations: functions that shuffle the values of a sequence.
- Distributions: functions that allow values to be chosen from a wide range of probability distributions.
- Random Generators: functions that allow the user to set the seed of the pseudorandom number generator.

Throughout the project I use 'random' as a descriptive term for readability purposes, even though everything generated from the **numpy.random** package is pseudorandom. To illustrate how each function operates, I use plots, descriptive statistics and some classic practical examples (coin flipping, card shuffling, etc.).
